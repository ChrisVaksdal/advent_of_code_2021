# Advent of Code 2021
AoC is a wonderful yearly event made by [Eric Wastl](https://github.com/topaz).
It is an advent calendar filled with programming puzzles that can be solved in any programming language.
Being an advent calendar, a new puzzle unlocks every day of December until Christmas.

This repository contains my solutions to the puzzles.
